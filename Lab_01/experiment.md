# Experiment

## Experimental Conditions

- Condition A (baseline value): No sprint, basic walk
- Condition B (changed value) : Sprint enabled , sprinting = faster speed, during cooldown, slower speed

## Hypothesis Alex

I hypothesise that B will have a higher amount of coins collects, with the user using sprint and will be faster at collecting the coins 

## Hypothesis David

I hypothesise that A will have a higher amount of coins collects, with the user not using sprint the game is simpler and less chance of error

## Design Decision

### Graph
[Graph](./../Graph.png)

above is the results of the avrages from the data

## Chosen value

The player will have Sprinting

We chose the player having sprint because the data showed the users were able to collect a lot more coins with the sprint on rather than the sprint off

we used the mean of the data

Alex's Hypothesis was correct
